<h1> Instagram clone project </h1>

This is an instagram prototype I made whilst following Karl Hadwen's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKeaaa8yAAk">tutorial on the subject</a>, therefore this is not my
code: it's <a href="https://github.com/karlhadwen/instagram">Karl's</a>, so you would be better served reading his repository. 

I undertook this walkthrough and impelemented his ideas in the space of a few days. The purpose of this 
was to get a glimpse of what the product lifecycle might look like. There were a few changes I undertook, but it was mostly due to how ESlinter was behaving, I also had to solve
a few minor problems because I was implementing the project on Windows. 

I would like to add that even though I was only shadowing what Karl was doing, it was quite gratifying
seeing the whole thing come together.
